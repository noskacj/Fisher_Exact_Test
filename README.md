# Fisher_Exact_Test

This code generates an approximation to the exact test, but the error in the approximation can be
reduced as much as the user would like. The test is nonparametric, and therefore is more robust to
errors in specification. For small samples an exact version of the above approximation is possible.
The time complexity of the exact exact (if you will) test is factorial (i.e. not good).
